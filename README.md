# JASRLP = Just Another Simple Reinforcement Learning (RL) Package

This is a very small collection of PyTorch RL packages.  
They're not intended to serve any real purpose, or even to work very well. 
I'm just coding them up for my own education and entertainment.
If you find anything useful here, great, I'm happy for you.

If you want something that works well, please look elsewhere.  e.g.
